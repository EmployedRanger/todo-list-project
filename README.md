Todo list made in JavaScript

Questions I have at this stage:
- Building pages now with functions, how do I know what is good
code versus bad code? Is there a way to know how production code is written?
---- starter package nodejs, nextjs, spelt
- Is it more common to build things using modules, factory functions, classes/static functions, etc?
- Is everything built in JS, and the JS builds out all the HTML? 
I believe this is called dynamic JS coding
- What are the more common style libraries used in the workplace?
- Are all JS functions that do work behind the scenes separate 
from the functions that deal with the DOM?
- When looking to hire someone, what should they be able to do to be 
valuable to you and the company?
---- build a photo slider (think amazon pictures with arrows)
- Are many static HTML/CSS sites still a thing or has JS been more popular?
